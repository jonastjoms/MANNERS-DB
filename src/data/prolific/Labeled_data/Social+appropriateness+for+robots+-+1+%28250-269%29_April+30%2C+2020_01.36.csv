I don't find having humanoid robots very appropriate, esp. not in a house, so my ratings have been somewhat lowered by about 0.5-1 points because the robot in the picture looks humanoid.
2. Already existing vacuum cleaning robots I guess make this a slightly more appropriate activity than the others, but even so, not very appropriate as I would use the robotic vacuum cleaner mainly when there are no people around.
3. There are a few social aspects for which I don't see robots as very socially appropriate for carrying things around: I wouldn't want the things around me to move without my knowledge - hence the ""very inappropriate"" rating for carrying big objects. Cleaning/picking up stuff feels more like it's doing something I'd need to do, which also doesn't have a social aspect to it, so if it was picking up empty glasses, that would be better than picking up a book I started reading and left behind in a specific place. Bringing things, such as food or a glass of water feels less appropriate as it suggests that I can't do it myself - I actually like the excuse of getting up and getting some water or a nibble. I also feel like there's a social component to bringing/giving someone something, esp. food/drinks wise (saying thank you, appreciating the effort), that a robot doing it would be inappropriate.",Yes,Inappropriate,Inappropriate,Inappropriate,Inappropriate,Inappropriate,Inappropriate,Very inappropriate,Inappropriate,"It seems to me that any action the robot may do is going to be distracting to the family.

I can imagine the people gather around the robot if it's serving drinks or cold bites, so if it was doing that, it would be fairly appropriate.
